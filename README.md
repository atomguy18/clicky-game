# React Memory Game

## Purpose

The purpose of the app was to learn the basics of react.js.

## Overview

This app is a memory game with using React.js.  The application's UI will be broken up into components, management of component states, and response to user events.

## The Memory Game Intructions

1.  The application should render different images with each image waiting to be clicked.

2.  The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
